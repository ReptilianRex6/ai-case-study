# Shield AI

Shield AI is a venture-backed defense technology company dedicated to safeguarding service members and civilians through intelligent systems. Utilizing artificial intelligence, the company has developed autonomous pilots capable of flying various aircraft without reliance on GPS, communications, or human intervention.

## Origins
The company was founded in 2015 by Brandon Tseng, Ryan Tseng, and Andrew Reiter. Brandon envisioned a military landscape in 2030 where AI pilots power every military asset, from aircraft and drones to ships, satellites, and submarines.

## Solutions
Shield AI's flagship product is [Hivemind](https://shield.ai/hivemind/), an AI pilot designed to autonomously operate an F-16 fighter jet. During the AlphaDogfight Trials, Hivemind decisively outperformed experienced human F-16 fighter pilots in a simulated aerial battle.

Additionally, the company has developed the V-BAT, whose role is to provide reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities for various military and security applications. V-BAT is a VTOL UAV that can take off and land vertically, hover in place, and fly for long durations. V-BAT can operate in austere and denied environments, where GPS and communications are jammed or unavailable. V-BAT can also work in teams with other V-BATs, using AI to coordinate and execute complex missions. (Microsoft Copilot)

## Target Customer
Shield AI aims to be the preferred aviation autonomy provider for the US, Allies, and partners, leveraging R&D associated with programs like DARPA ACE, Gamebreaker, JAWS, AFRL AACO, Golden Horde, and AFWERX STRATFI.

## Competition
According to web sources and Microsoft, some competitors include:
- **AeroVironment:** Develops unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and tactical missile systems.
- **Skydio:** Creates self-flying drones using computer vision and deep learning.
- **Delair:** Provides end-to-end drone solutions for various industries. 

What sets Shield AI apart from its competitors is the fact that they have an artificial pilot that has proven itself with the competitions and contracts it has won like the [Air Force STRATFI Contract](https://shield.ai/shield-ai-awarded-max-afwerx-stratfi-contract-focused-on-operational-intelligent/).

## Funding Announcement
On October 31, 2023, Shield AI Newsroom announced a $200 million Series F funding round, led by U.S. Innovative Technology Fund (USIT) and co-led by Riot Ventures. The funding, with participation from ARK Invest and other investors, [values Shield AI at $2.7 billion.](https://shield.ai/shield-ai-raises-200m-reaching-2-7b-valuation/)

## In conclusion
I am very impressed with the company, especially its advancements in AI-driven aviation. I'm ooking forward to witnessing further innovations. I would recommend that they continue testing Hivemind on aircraft currently used today, like the F/A-18 or the F35 to further push the edge of possibility.
