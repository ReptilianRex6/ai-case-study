# Sheild AI

## Overview and Origin

* Sheild AI  is a venture-backed defense technology company whose mission is to protect service members and civilians with intelligent systems. Using AI, the company has created artificially inteligent pilots to fly a variety of aircraft autonomously, without the need for GPS, communications, or human intervention.

The company was founded in 2015 by Brandon Tseng, Ryan Tseng, and Andrew Reiter.
 Brandon asked "what does the military of 2030 look like and what role does autonomy play. The answer – AI pilots powering every military asset: aircraft, drones, ships, satellites and submarines. "

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Shield AI has created an AI pilot called Hivemind. It has been designed to fly an F-16 fighter jet autonimosly like stated previously: "without the need for GPS, communications, or human intervention." The aircraft uses sensors to create a map or world-view, the computer then tells the aircraft or autopilot where to go and what to do to execute its mission. "Our AI pilot was the decisive winner against experienced human F-16 fighter pilots in a simulated aerial battle during the AlphaDogfight Trials."

They also have amazing aircraft. One is called V-BAT, whos V-BAT’s role is to provide reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities for various military and security applications. V-BAT is a VTOL UAV that can take off and land vertically, hover in place, and fly for long durations. V-BAT can operate in austere and denied environments, where GPS and communications are jammed or unavailable. V-BAT can also work in teams with other V-BATs, using AI to coordinate and execute complex missions. (Microsoft Copilot)
