# Sheild AI

Shield AI is a venture-backed defense technology company dedicated to safeguarding service members and civilians through intelligent systems. Utilizing artificial intelligence, the company has developed autonomous pilots capable of flying various aircraft without reliance on GPS, communications, or human intervention.
## Origins
The company was founded in 2015 by Brandon Tseng, Ryan Tseng, and Andrew Reiter. Brandon asked "what does the military of 2030 look like and what role does autonomy play. The answer – AI pilots powering every military asset: aircraft, drones, ships, satellites and submarines. "

## Solutions
Shield AI's flagship product is an AI pilot named Hivemind, specifically designed to autonomously operate an F-16 fighter jet as mentioned earlier, "without the need for GPS, communications, or human intervention." The aircraft employs sensors to create a comprehensive map or world-view. The computer then guides the autopilot, instructing it on where to go and what actions to take to fulfill its mission. Notably, during the AlphaDogfight Trials, "our AI pilot decisively outperformed experienced human F-16 fighter pilots in a simulated aerial battle."

They also have amazing aircraft. One is called V-BAT, whos role is to provide reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities for various military and security applications. V-BAT is a VTOL UAV that can take off and land vertically, hover in place, and fly for long durations. V-BAT can operate in austere and denied environments, where GPS and communications are jammed or unavailable. V-BAT can also work in teams with other V-BATs, using AI to coordinate and execute complex missions. (Microsoft Copilot)

## Target Customer
They claim to be the preferred aviation autonomy provider for the US, Allies, and partners through leveraging R&D associated with programs like DARPA ACE, Gamebreaker, JAWS, AFRL AACO, Golden Horde, AFWERX STRATFI
